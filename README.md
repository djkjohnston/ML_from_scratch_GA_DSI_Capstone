# DSI Capstone - Machine Learning from Scratch

The goal of this project is to implement common/known machine learning algorithms using vanilla `python` and `numpy` only. `sklearn` will be used only as A) a source of datasets for testing (both toy and generated) and B) comparing the performance of manually defined algorithms.

To do:

* LinearRegression solved analytically (i.e. with linear algebra vs gradient descent)
* LogisticRegression
* KNearestNeighborsClassifier
* KNearestNeighborsRegressor
* Others

Each class should have the following capabilities:

* Instantiation
* Fitting
* Prediction
* Scoring
	* R^2 for regression
	* Accuracy for classification
	* Consider adding others
	
Status:

* **LinearRegression**
	* First draft completed, 11/25/2017
	* Used Boston dataset for comparison
	* R2 scores are analagous when compared to sklearn:
		* From Scratch: 0.740607742865
		* Sklearn: 0.740607742865
	* From scratch appears to be quicker, but that may not prove true at scale
		* From Scratch: 153 µs ± 30.5 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
		* Sklearn: 438 µs ± 9.06 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
* **LogisticRegression**
	* First draft completed, 11/26/2017
	* Used Breast Cancer dataset for comparison
	* Accuracy scores are analagous when compared to sklearn:
		* From Scratch: 0.965034965035
		* Sklearn: 0.979020979021
	* From scratch appears to be quicker, but that may not prove true at scale
		* From Scratch: 
563 µs ± 55.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
		* Sklearn: 3.52 ms ± 86.3 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
	* Set up for binary classification only right now. Also need to figure out how to return probabilities?
* **KNeighborsRegressor**
	* First draft completed 11/25/2017
	* Used Boston dataset for comparison	
	* R2 scores are identical when compared to sklearn:
		* From Scratch: 0.639665439953224
		* Sklearn: 0.639665439953224
	* From scratch appears to be much slower, but hope to change with further revisions
		* From Scratch: 411 ms ± 9.18 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
			* Update 11/27/2017: 2.28 ms ± 79.3 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
		* Sklearn: 969 µs ± 29.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
* **KNeighborsClassifier**
	* First draft completed 11/26/2017
	* Used Breast Canser  dataset for comparison
	* Accuracy scores are identical when compared to sklearn:
		* From Scratch: 0.965034965034965
		* Sklearn: 0.965034965034965
	* From scratch appears to be much slower, but hope to change with further revisions
		* From Scratch: 506 ms ± 14.6 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
			* Update 11/27/2017: updated distance function resulting in a shorter run time: 5.83 ms ± 68.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
		* Sklearn: 1.21 ms ± 47 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
* **KMeans**
	* First draft completed 11/29/2017
	* used `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs` for comparison
		* `make_blobs(n_samples=10000, n_features=12, centers=5, random_state=42)`
	* Runtime:
		* From Scratch: 328 ms ± 24.9 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
		* Sklearn: 64.4 ms ± 1.66 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
	* Cluster: Taking this with a grain of salt since KMeans performance depends so much on the starting points used

		* Sklearn: <img src='https://git.generalassemb.ly/raw/dannyboyjohnston/dsi_capstone_ml_from_scratch/master/assets/sklearn_kmeans_blobs_pairplot.png'>
* **DBScan**
	* First draft completed 11/30/2017
	* used `sklearn.datasets.make_moons` for comparison
		* `make_moons(n_samples=1000, random_state=42)`
	* Runtime: Sklearn is nearly 10x faster
		* From Scratch: 62.7 ms ± 3.91 ms per loop
		* Sklearn: 7.63 ms ± 310 µs per loop
	* Cluster: They are identical

	* Notes:
		* From Scratch implimentation 'grows' out from all custered points with a distance of `r`. Typical visualizations show DBScan adding new point from one observation at a time.
		
* **DBScan, second implimentation**
	* First draft completed 12/11/2017
		* used `sklearn.datasets.make_moons` for comparison
		* second implimentation is slower with small samples but is much faster at scale compared to initial implimentation:
			* uses a boolean array to manage which cases are within a working cluster
			* scans from point to point, using a queue to manage which points need to be scanned.
	* Runtime: Sklearn is still faster
		* `make_moons(n_samples=1000, random_state=42)`
			* From Scratch mk1: 33.8 ms ± 1.21 ms per loop
			* From Scratch mk2: 45.3 ms ± 3.84 ms per loop
			* Sklearn: 8.07 ms ± 204 µs per loop
		* `make_moons(n_samples=10000, random_state=42)`
			* From Scratch mk1: 39.8 s ± 11 s per loop
			* From Scratch mk2: 2.87 s ± 275 ms per loop
			* Sklearn: 722 ms ± 40.6 ms per loop
	* Clusters are identical

* **Hierarchical Clustering**
	* First draft completed 12/4/2017
	* Algorithm uses the bottom up approach. I am using Sklearn's AgglomerativeClustering for comparison.
	* Used dummy data created by `make_blobs(n_samples=10, n_features=2, centers=5, random_state=42)` for testing and comparison
	* Runtime:
		* From Scratch: 220 µs ± 9.47 µs per loop
		* Sklearn: 148 µs ± 3.74 µs per loop 
	* Notes:
		* From Scratch does not scale well. I expect the use of `np.where` is a bottleneck.
